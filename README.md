# MATLAB scripts

In this repo you will find some basic scripts to show how to work with data from Prophesee sensors in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
These scripts require a [DAT file](https://docs.prophesee.ai/data_formats/file_formats/dat.html) as an input with data recorded with [one of our cameras](https://docs.prophesee.ai/hw/index.html). 

If you only have a RAW file, you need to convert it to DAT format first. To this end, use our application [metavision_raw_to_dat](https://docs.prophesee.ai/metavision_sdk/modules/driver/guides/raw_to_dat.html)
which is part of [Metavision Intelligence Suite](https://www.prophesee.ai/metavision-intelligence/).

To try out those scripts, you can also download and use one of the [RAW and DAT files we provide](https://docs.prophesee.ai/datasets.html).

## Main features

The MATLAB scripts allow to:
  * [`load_atis_data.m`](load_atis_data.m): uploads CD events to MATLAB
  * [`load_atis_aps.m`](load_atis_aps.m): uploads EM events to MATLAB (deprecated for the current sensor generation)
  * [`load_ext_trigger_data.m`](load_ext_trigger_data.m): uploads data from external triggers to MATLAB
  * [`play_cd_recording.m`](play_cd_recording.m): generates a video from CD events
  * [`atis_snapshot.m`](atis_snapshot.m): generates gray-scale images from EM events (deprecated for the current sensor generation)

Note that by default the provided scripts will attempt to upload the entire DAT files into memory. 
Therefore, it will be useful to split your DAT file into several smaller files at first, or modify the Matlab scripts to limit the memory requirements.


## Uploading CD data to MATLAB


The script [`load_atis_data.m`](load_atis_data.m) provides an example of uploading CD events to MATLAB.

The function `load_atis_data` requires the following input arguments:
  * path to DAT file with recorded CD events
  * flipX flag - for flipping data over the X axis (0 by default)
  * flipY flag - for flipping data over the Y axis (0 by default)

The script returns a data structure containing the following fields for every CD event:

  * `x` - x-position of the event in the sensor matrix
  * `y` - y-position of the event in the sensor matrix
  * `ts` - timestamp of the event
  * `p` - polarity of the event

Example of script execution:
```
cd_data = load_atis_data("/path/to/my_record.dat")
```

## Generating a video and frames from CD events

The script [`play_cd_recording.m`](play_cd_recording.m) provides an example of generating a video from CD events and replaying this video.

The function `play_cd_recording` requires the following input arguments:
  * `filename` - path to a DAT file with recorded CD events
  * `width` - width of the sensor
  * `height` - height of the sensor
  * `framerate` - frame rate of the output file
  * `acc_time` - accumulation time (in microseconds). This is the duration during which each event will be shown

The script returns a structure containing a sequence of frames generated by iteratively accumulating
the information from the CD events. Each frame shows the CD events generated by the sensor over the given 
accumulation time duration preceding the timestamp associated with the frame. For instance, if the given frame rate 
is 1000 FPS (frames per seconds) and the accumulation time is 10000 µs (microseconds), each CD event will be displayed
during 10 frames.

For example, for a [Gen3 sensor](https://docs.prophesee.ai/hw/sensors/PPS3MVCD.html), the following command will generate a 25 FPS video with the accumulation time of 10000 µs:
```
play_td_recording('/path/to/my_record.dat',640,480,25,10000)
```
